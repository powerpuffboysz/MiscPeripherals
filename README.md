MiscPeripheral
==============

My attempt at maintaining this great mod, from the source code posted by @richardg867


Currently:
  * Building an environement for building this with 1.6.2 as it was written.
  * Updating the API's for the various pieces, to be compatible with the versions of those mods in the popular
    1.6.4 mod packs.

Whats been done:
  Not really a damned thing, this sorta thing will take me a bit as I'm somewhat unfamiliar with Java
  
  
What to expect / ideas:
  I don't really know, my time is somewhat limited, but if I get some good successes from building the environment, then I'll work on expanding the feature set / fixing bugs.
  
  Personally I was always annoyed at the TTS system requiring external software.  I'd like to internalize it entirely - even at the expense of quality, I think the lo-fi TTS voices of the early software in that area is quite fitting in the minecraft environment
  
    Help/forks push/pull request completely appreciated, and wanted

IRC:
    I created #MiscPeripherals on esper.net to aid in the programming process.
